My Aerospace Engineering B.S. Capstone, in which our small team designed a small, two-stage, solid-propellant rocket to carry a payload to a desired altitude and deploy a parachute to return the payload safely to ground.  My work was centered on the rocket structural design, motor choice, and structural calculations both by-hand and computer-assisted.
